## Installation

In order to use this application you need to have installed the following packages

- [PYENV](https://www.cherryservers.com/blog/how-to-install-pip-ubuntu): handles the python versions. Very useful when working with virtual environments.
- [PIP](https://www.cherryservers.com/blog/how-to-install-pip-ubuntu): handles the needed python dependencies.

Once installed, follow these instructions:

- Open the console and type `pyenv install`. This command will read the **.python-version** file and automatically install the specified version
